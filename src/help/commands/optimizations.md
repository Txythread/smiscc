**Optimizations**

Specific optimizations can be set or unset using the `--optimizations` flag followed by the operations that should be turned on/off.  
To turn it on, just write the name of the optimization (list available in `OPTIMIZATIONS.md` in the compiler's source code). To turn it off, prefix it with an exclamation mark.  
*Note:* Whether optimizations are enabled or disabled w/o the flag depends on its standard optimization level. Checkout `--ol` for more.
