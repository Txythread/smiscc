**Optimization Level**

The optimization level can be set using `--ol` the lowest level is 0, meaning basically no optimizations, the highest is 3, meaning all optimizations.  
Specific optimizations can be toggled with the `--optimizations` flag.  
For more details, check OPTIMIZATIONS.md in the compiler's source code.
