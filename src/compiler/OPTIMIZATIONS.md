# Optimizations

## Fundamentals
Optimizations are assigned by the optimization level, which can be specified using the `--ol` flag. If a user wishes to, they can set or unset specific optimizations by specifying the name of the operation and adding a `!`as a prefix if they wish to turn it off.  
All kinds of optimizations are declared in `src/compiler/optimizations.rs` in the `OptimizationKind` enum. 

## Appropriate Levels
**Level 0** is only for optimizations that shouldn't need to exist if we're being honest. It cleans up garbage generated by the compiler.  
**Level 1** is for optimizations that may alter the user's code in a foreseeable, but potentially unexpected way. There's nothing to complex going on in this level.  
**Level 2 and 3** are for optimizations to the user's code that drastically alter it and obfuscate the resulting assembly.
